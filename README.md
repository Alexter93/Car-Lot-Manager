# Car-Lot-Manager
A simple management tool that allows for a user to add different cars to a car lot. It is split into tabs: one to add vehicles into the car lot and another to view the itmes in the car lot. At this point in working with Java, I was starting to get more familar with java pannels, was still getting used to action listeners and exceptions. Disptire that, this program uses them effectivly. <br/>
