# Car-Lot-Manager
A simple management tool that allows for a user to add different cars to a car lot. It is split into tabs: one to add vehicles into the car lot and another to view the itmes in the car lot. At this point in working with Java, I was starting to get more familar with java pannels, was still getting used to action listeners and exceptions. Disptire that, this program uses them effectivly. <br/>

## Instructions
Adding a car to the lot requires you to enter at least the car’s number of doors, number of cylinders and car’s price. One you do that, you click the “Add to Motor Pool” button, and the entry you just added should appear below. You can switch to the list of cars and back by clicking the tabs in the lower left corner of the window.
